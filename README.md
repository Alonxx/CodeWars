# CodeWars

Codewars.com is a platform where you solve javascript problems by way of practicing the methods and logic of programming

These are the exercises that I have been solving in my practices on the CodeWars website

It may also contain some practice exercises done in Henry's bootcamp but they usually exist in CodeWars as well.
